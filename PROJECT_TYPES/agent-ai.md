# Agent/AI Development Patterns

Key patterns for AI agent development based on Catalyst Weave, using [Google ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/).

## Core Principles

### Google ADK-Based Architecture
- Use ADK agent framework as foundation
- Structure agents with clear responsibilities
- Implement proper validation protocols

### Testing and Validation
- Comprehensive test protocols
- Safety constraint validation
- Edge case testing
- Performance benchmarks

### Human-in-the-Loop
- Confidence thresholds for human review
- Feedback incorporation mechanisms
- Clear review workflows

## Documentation Requirements

**architecture.md**: Agent design, components, data flow
**capabilities.md**: What the agent can/cannot do
**safety.md**: Safety considerations, constraints, monitoring

## Key Practices

- Document agent capabilities and limitations clearly
- Implement safety constraints from the start
- Build in comprehensive testing protocols
- Design for human review when needed
- Keep observability and logging throughout
